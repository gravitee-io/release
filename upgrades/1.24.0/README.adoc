= Upgrade to 1.24.0

== User creation REST API

We have added the possibility to create users from the UI.
Previously the POST on `/management/users` was used to register a user.
Now this is used to create a user on the platform and the registration service has been moved under `/management/users/registration` and `/management/users/registration/finalize`.
