= Upgrade to 1.23.0

== Groups of users

This version comes with an improvement on how to manage groups of users.
On previous releases, the group administrator could add members from the user search only.

From now, it will be able to add members not only from this search but also by email.
By default neither of them is available, so in this case only the administrator of the platform will be able to add some.

So for the existing groups, you will have to enable the search mode to allow group administrators to add members.
