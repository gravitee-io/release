= Upgrade to 3.9.4

== Breaking changes

From this version, configuration form for JSON Threat Protection Policy and XML Threat Protection Policy changes:
`null` is no longer authorized, only `-1` is accepted for a 'no limit' setting.

=== Impacts

- If some fields are set to `null` in your db, and if you want to edit this policy configuration through *API Console*, then the form will replace them by the default value. Please, be careful when updating your policy if you do not want the default values to be applied.
- If some fields are set to `null` in your db, and if you want to edit this policy configuration through *REST API*, an error message will appear if you do not set an explicit value for those fields in your request payload.
