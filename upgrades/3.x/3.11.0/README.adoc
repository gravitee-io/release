= Upgrade to 3.11.0

== Breaking changes

From with this version, the name of the APIM Rest APIs component changes.
As a consequence:

1. The APIM Rest API component available on https://download.gravitee.io is now `gravitee-*apim*-rest-api-x.y.z.zip` instead of `gravitee-management-rest-api-x.y.z.zip`

2. The name of the APIM Rest API folder within the full distribution zip file (graviteeio-full-x.y.z.zip) is now `graviteeio-*apim*-rest-api-x.y.z` instead of `graviteeio-rest-api-x.y.z`


WARNING: In future versions, others plugins & components might be renamed. Stay tuned!
