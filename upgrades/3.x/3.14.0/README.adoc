= Upgrade to 3.14.0

== Breaking changes

=== Gateway
From with this version, the name of the APIM Gateway component changes.
As a consequence:

1. The APIM Gateway component available on https://download.gravitee.io is now `gravitee-*apim-gateway*-x.y.z.zip` instead of `gravitee-gateway-x.y.z.zip`

2. The name of the APIM Gateway folder within the full distribution zip file (graviteeio-full-x.y.z.zip) is now `graviteeio-*apim-gateway*-x.y.z` instead of `graviteeio-gateway-x.y.z`

. The bridge server gateway
. The bridge client gateway
