= Upgrade to 3.17.0

== Breaking Changes
=== Management API Documentation

From this version, APIM's Management API documentation is now using OpenAPI v3 format, instead of the old Swagger v2 format.

As a consequence, the specification of this API is now accessible from:

 * `{host:port}/management/openapi.yaml`
 * `{host:port}/management/openapi.json`

To allow a smooth transition, the old URL (`{host:port}/management/swagger.json`) will remain available until 3.18.0.
