= Upgrade to 3.2.0

== Breaking changes
The `portalURL` parameter in the gravitee.yml file has been removed.
It has become useless with this issue https://github.com/gravitee-io/issues/issues/4069[#4069].

As a consequence, the `subscriptionUrl` used in the email notification template `subscriptionReceived.html` is now based on the *management URL* parameter, that can be configured in the console settings.
