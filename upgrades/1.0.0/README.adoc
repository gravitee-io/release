= Upgrade to 1.0.0

== Repository
=== Mongodb
We have refactored how Gravitee.io manages memberships.
If you have a 0.x.x version of Gravitee.io using the Mongodb Repositoy, you have 2 scripts to run to migrate your datas.

upgrades/1.0.0/mongodb/1-copy-members-to-memberships.js::
This script creates the new `memberships` collection in MongoDB and add all api/application members.
It does not remove old values from the `apis` and `applications` collections.

upgrades/1.0.0/mongodb/1-copy-members-to-memberships.js::
This script removes old datas. **It must be run after** `1-copy-members-to-memberships.js`
**This operation is irreversible**.
